## How does it work?
Register to create your own lists. You can get started by selecting destinations for your trip. In Journey Log, you will find a huge variety of landmarks, museums, and other interesting places all around the world. After you add places you want to visit, you can start planning your trip.
Create lists of places you want to visit, and add photos and notes about places you have already visited. Journey Log will help you make a travel plan so you can easily determine the order of places to visit and the dates you plan to visit them. 

## Plans
We also plan to create an opportunity to share your memories with friends, as well as create common ones. Also create shared lists of the places you want to visit with family and friends. It is also planned to add a navigator and the ability to build a route in a certain order or lay the shortest path through the entire list of places.
